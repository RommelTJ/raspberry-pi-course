# Building your first raspberry pi circuit

## How to safely manipulate your board

- You can't get hurt.
- But you can damage your raspberry pi.
- ALWAYS power off your Pi first if you make a change in the circuit.
- When powered on, avoid touching the circuit. This may cause electrostatic discharge.
- DOUBLE AND TRIPLE CHECK everything before plugging the power cable.
- Start the circuit by connecting the GND (ground) for all components.
- Don't put a 5V signal on a GPIO pin (3.3V max).

## Understand how a Breadboard Works

- Useful for prototyping and testing.
- You can plug in wires, resistors, LEDs, etc.
- Underneath the board, there are wires connecting all components on this line.
- The blue line is the GND (ground) line.
- The red line is the 5V (power) line.
- All the dots are connected to the same line.
- The dots in the middle are connected vertically. That's where you connect the GPIO pins.
