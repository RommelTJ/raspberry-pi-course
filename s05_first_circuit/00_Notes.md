# Building your first raspberry pi circuit

## How to safely manipulate your board

- You can't get hurt.
- But you can damage your raspberry pi.
- ALWAYS power off your Pi first if you make a change in the circuit.
- When powered on, avoid touching the circuit. This may cause electrostatic discharge.
- DOUBLE AND TRIPLE CHECK everything before plugging the power cable.
- Start the circuit by connecting the GND (ground) for all components.
- Don't put a 5V signal on a GPIO pin (3.3V max).
