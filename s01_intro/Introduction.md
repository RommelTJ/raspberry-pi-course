# Introduction

## Materials Used

To follow along in this course, you will need the following materials:

- A Raspberry Pi (Version 5 with 4GB RAM is recommended, but I'll be using a Pi 4)
- A microSD card (at least a class 10 card with 32gb of storage)
- A power supply (Recommended is to use the official one from Raspberry Pi)
- For the GPIO exercises: 
  - 1 breadboard
  - Set of wires: male-to-male, male-to-female, and female-to-female
  - Set of resistors (1k Ohm)
  - 3 LEDs of any color
  - 1 push button (4 legs)
  - Note: You can usually find these components bundled as a "breadboard kit".
- For the PIR sensor exercises and the final project:
  - A PIR sensor (model: HC-SR501)
  - Note: The cheapest ones tend to break, so having 2-3 of them is recommended.
- For the camera exercises and the final project:
  - A Pi camera v3 (2 options)
    - "Standard" Pi camera V3 (recommended) mounted on a green board
    - "NoIR" Pi Camera V3, mounted on a black board. 
    - The advantage of the "NoIR" camera is that you can use it in the dark. 
      Daylight images look better with the standard camera.

## Course Structure

The course should be followed in order. Each section will have a set of exercises to complete.
