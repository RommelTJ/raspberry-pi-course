# Python Programming - Variables and Functions

## First Python Program

* Using Thonny IDE
* See 01_hello.py

## Variables

* A container for storing data
* You must give it a name, and then assign it a value.
* See 02_variables.py for variable uses

## Data Types

* Data types
  * Integers
  * Floats
  * Strings
  * Booleans
* See 03_datatypes.py
* In Python, variable types are dynamic. They can change

## Functions

* A function is a reusable piece of code that you can call from anywhere in your program.
* See 04_functions.py

## Variable Scopes

* Variables have scopes
* Depending on where they are declared, they can be used in different parts of your program.
* Types of scopes
* Global scope
  * Variables declared in the global scope can be used anywhere in the program.
* Local scope
  * Variables declared in the local scope can only be used in the function where they are declared.
* Function parameters are local variables.
* See 05_scopes.py
